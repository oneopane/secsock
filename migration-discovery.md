# Migration Discovery for secsock
Date: Thu Aug 28 17:36:59 PDT 2025

## ArrayList Usage
```
vendor/bearssl/build.zig:14:    var macro_list = std.ArrayList(MacroPair).init(b.allocator);
```

## std.io Usage
```
```

## Format Strings
```
vendor/s2n-tls/build.zig:27:        std.debug.print("On non-Linux platforms, you must provide libssl and libcrypto installed on system.", .{});
```

## Writer/Reader Patterns (Critical for Writergate)
### Generic IO Types (Must be converted to concrete types)
```
```

### BufferedWriter/Reader (Deleted - needs refactoring)
```
```

### Stdout/Stderr patterns (Need buffer management)
```
```

### File IO patterns
```
```

### Stream methods that changed
```
```

### Functions with anytype parameters (likely writer/reader)
```
```

## Deprecated APIs
```
```
